If you're a React.js developer like me, chances are you're using **custom hooks** in almost every project. 👨‍💻

And, like many of us, you've probably stashed them away in some folder named _"hooks"_ inside your project, ready to copy-paste them whenever needed. 🫠

Well, I'm here to solve part of that problem—or at least make it a bit easier for you. 🤌

## Introducing **`use-any-hook`**

Not long ago, I published a small npm package called [**`use-any-hook`**](https://lnkd.in/drKJj4Qj). Its purpose is simple yet powerful:  
It gathers a collection of commonly used **custom hooks** in one place, making them accessible through straightforward imports.

Instead of repeatedly creating and managing the same hooks across projects, you can now rely on this package to:

- Save time.
- Reduce redundancy.
- Keep your codebase organized.

Check it out and give it a spin!
